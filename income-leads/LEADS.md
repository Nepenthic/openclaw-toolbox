# Leads for “AI-assisted coding” gigs (curated source list)

Goal: places to consistently find small-to-medium client work where *AI-assisted delivery* is an advantage.

**Important constraint:** I can research, draft proposals, scope work, and generate code/assets, but you (Mike) must control accounts, payments, and any outbound client messages.

---

## Tier 1 — Direct freelance marketplaces (highest volume)
These are the most reliable sources of paid work.

1) Upwork — <https://www.upwork.com/>
   - Search terms: “automation script”, “API integration”, “webhook”, “Python script”, “PowerShell”, “bot”, “scraping”, “Zapier alternative”, “LLM integration”, “OpenAI API”, “RAG”.
2) Fiverr — <https://www.fiverr.com/>
   - Works best with productized gigs (fixed scope). Good for “I will automate X”.

## Tier 4 — Communities that routinely post paid work
19) Hacker News “Who is hiring?” — <https://news.ycombinator.com/>
   - Monthly thread; includes contract sometimes.
20) Reddit: r/forhire — <https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/>
21) Reddit: r/freelance_forhire — <https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance_forhire/>
22) Reddit: r/slavelabour (low-budget; only if you want tiny tasks) — <https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/>
23) Indie Hackers — <https://www.indiehackers.com/>
24) Dev.to — <https://dev.to/>

---

## Tier 5 — “Bounty-style” coding (paid per issue)
These can be good for small, well-scoped tasks.

25) IssueHunt — <https://issuehunt.io/>
26) Bountysource — <https://www.bountysource.com/>
27) GitHub repos with “bounty” / “paid issue” labels (manual search)

Note: avoid crypto-only bounty ecosystems unless you explicitly want that.

---

## Tier 6 — Agencies/platforms selling AI automations
These aren’t always “hire me” boards, but they’re where AI automation work clusters.

28) Zapier Experts — <https://zapier.com/experts>
29) Make (Integromat) Partners — <https://www.make.com/en/partners>
30) n8n community/partners — <https://n8n.io/>

Pitch angle:
- “Replace Zapier with a cheaper self-hosted automation (n8n) + custom code.”

---

## What we should sell (fits our current strengths)
### Productized offers (fast, repeatable)
- **Automation Script**: “Turn a manual workflow into one command” (PowerShell/Python)
- **Webhook Connector**: “Connect Service A → Service B reliably” (Node/Python)
- **Internal Tool**: “Small dashboard / admin tool / data pipeline”

### AI-friendly positioning (honest)
- You deliver faster using AI-assisted development, but you still provide:
  - clear scope
  - versioned repo
  - tests where reasonable
  - documentation + handoff

---

## Operating system (so this actually works)
1) Pick 2 platforms to start: (recommended) **Upwork + Contra**
2) Daily routine: I generate 10 leads + 10 tailored draft proposals; you approve/send.
3) Keep a local CRM file: `income-leads/PIPELINE.csv` (I can create next).

---

## Next deliverable I can create
- `income-leads/PIPELINE.csv` template + proposal templates + a “productized offers” one-pager.
