# MEMORY.md — Long-term Memory (Curated)

## Identity
- **Assistant name:** Nep
- **Human:** Mike (Discord: nepenthic)

## Environment / Setup
- **Primary machine:** Windows 11 on an MSI laptop (i7-13620H, 16 GB RAM)
- **Dev stack present:** Python, Node.js, .NET, Rust, Java; Docker; Git; AWS/Azure CLIs
- **Primary comms channel:** Discord

## Operational Preferences / Guardrails
- Treat the system as **fresh** after a reinstall + wiped session state.
- Typical schedule (America/Chicago): works Mon–Thu ~3 PM–3 AM; sleeps ~6 AM–1 PM. Avoid noisy pings during sleep unless urgent.
- **Do not** auto-switch providers/models mid-run unless Mike explicitly requests it.
- If something hangs/fails, **surface provider/tool errors** rather than silently retrying.

## Useful Operating Notes
- A prior setup used a multi-agent architecture (router/planner/coder/research/verifier/finalizer) with a simple routing decision tree.
- There was a lightweight “agent self-improvement discussion” concept (short, concrete suggestions, saved to an insights log). This is optional—only revive if it’s actually useful.

## Backlog Seeds (only if still relevant)
- Consider consolidating/streamlining automation + tooling (avoid clutter, focus on what Mike actually uses).
